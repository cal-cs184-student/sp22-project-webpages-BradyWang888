		Overview:
		</h1>
		<p>
		In this project, I implemented a rasterizer which supports basic rasterizaing operations as well as texture mapping. i have learnt the lower level working details
			of rasterizaing and texture mapping.

		Task1:
		</h1>
		<p>
		1:I first find the bounding box of the triangle. Then I iterate over all the pixels inside the bounding box and check whether the point is inside
			the triangle according to the formula described in the lecture(if all 3 line equations return negative/positive at the same time then it is 
			inside the triangle). Then I call fill_pixel() on that pixel.
		<br> 2: As described above.
